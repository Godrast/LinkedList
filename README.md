# LinkedList


This was a project that I created to teach myself about this data structure. It reuquires to be commented. It's not fully developed as there are missing features like looking for a specific value/removing it or checking if value exists in the linked list.

Sorting method was mostly based on merge sort that is found on Geeks for Geeks website ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-for-linked-list/ )
I would like to point out that it was not copied and pasted, as I used it as a reference while also learning how to use merge sort.

Everything has to be included in the header file, as splitting it into a class and header file was troublesome with using templates. I tried some methods to fix that, only mehtod involved having to include both class and header file in the project, which would be annoying, so I decidede to keep all of it in header.
